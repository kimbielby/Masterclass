# TODO: Segment person
#           Simulate green spill
#           - add a green halo around edges
#           - tint the skin, hair and clothes near the edges slightly green:
#               expand the mask of the person by a few pixels and blend green into these regions
#               add green to the shadows/reflections

# todo: OpenCV or PIL for basic blending
#         Use shader-like effects for more realism

# TODO:
#       1. Read in all images, shuffle then split into train-val-test and save in those dirs
#       2. Go through individually to remove remaining non-viable images - DONE!
#       3. Segment people - not just faces - and simulate green spill
#           - try on just a few images first
#       4. These will be saved in separate folder
