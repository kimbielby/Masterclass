# TODO: Segment person
#           Simulate green spill
#           - add a green halo around edges
#           - tint the skin, hair and clothes near the edges slightly green:
#               expand the mask of the person by a few pixels and blend green into these regions
#               add green to the shadows/reflections

# todo: OpenCV or PIL for basic blending
#         Use shader-like effects for more realism
