# TODO: Create pipeline to train model with dataset
#           - Maybe U-Net architecture?
#           - Use pre-trained model?
#           - Augmentation: shift; rotation; deformation; varying intensity values
#           - Upsampling?
#           - Early stopping?
#           - Encoder lr = 1e-4; Decoder lr = 5e-4
#           - Small batch size (8)?
#           - Resize to 256 x 256, or 512 x 512
#           - Eval metrics: MSE, SAD?
